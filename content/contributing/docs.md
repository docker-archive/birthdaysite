Documentation is an integral part of any open source project.  It supplies the
common thread that unifies all users, from helping new users get up to speed to
offering detailed explanations of features for seasoned developers.

Contibute to documentation if you like to analyze how something works and then
explain it to others.  

# What can you contribute to documentation?

If you don't want to write, you can make other kinds of documentation
contributions:

* Report an issue or request new documentation.  
* <a href="/contributing/tests/#test-the-docker-documentation" target="_blank">Test</a> the existing documentation.
* <a href="/contributing/tests/#write-new-or-update-existing-documentation">Write new or update existing documentation</a>.


# Report a documentation issue

Before you try this task, make sure you have a <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">Github account</a>.

1.  Encounter an issue in our documentation.

	Your issue could be a poor explanation, a missing step in a procedure, or a
	feature you want &mdash; a new tutorial for example.

2.  Go to the appropriate repo.
	
	You can report issues with any Docker project:
	
	* <a href="http://goo.gl/HZ25kq" target="_blank">Docker</a>

	Docker repositories</a> on GitHub.
	
3.  Click the **New issue** button.

4.  Give your issue a **Title**.

5.  Leave a comment describing your issue.

	If you found the problem in existing documentation, add the page's URL to your
	description.
	

# Write new or update existing documentation

Writing documentation requires you to fork the Docker repo and write source
using Markdown code.  We have a <a href="http://docs.docker.com/project">guide that walks you through the entire process</a>.
