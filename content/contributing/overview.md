Contributing to the Docker project, and to any open source project, can
be a rewarding experience both in that you can help yourself
and projects you are working on, as well as the countless number of
others you may help with your contribution.

Open source projects depend on a lot more than just code to be
successful. Proper documentation, testing, training, publicity, support and
organization are all critical.

In addition to this guide, weâ€™ve found [GitHub's guide on contributing
to open source](https://guides.github.com/overviews/os-contributing/) to
be a helpful guide to contributing in general.

This document was inspired by the [jQuery contributor
guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/open-source/).
