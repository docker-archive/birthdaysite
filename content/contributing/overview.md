Contributing to the Docker project, and to any open source project, can
be a rewarding experience both in terms of the way you can help yourself
and projects you are working on, as well as the countless number of
others you may help with your contribution.

Open source projects depend on a lot more than just code to be
successful. Proper documentation, testing, training, publicity, support and
organization are all critical.

If it’s your first time contributing to open source we strongly suggest
you start with our [First Time Guide](/contributing/first-time/).

In addition to this guide, we’ve found [GitHub's guide on contributing
to open source](https://guides.github.com/overviews/os-contributing/) to
be quite helpful.

This document was inspired by the [jQuery contributor
guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/open-source/).
