# Code contribution workflow

Below is the general workflow for contributing Docker code or documentation.
Experienced open source contributors, may already have what they need use this
workflow. If you need details or reminders, each step links off to the
appropriate details in our official project contributors guide.

1. <a href="http://docs.docker.com/project/software-required/"
target="_blank">Get the software</a> you need.

	This explains how to install a couple of tools used in our development
	environment.  What you need (or don't need) might surprise you.

2. <a href="http://docs.docker.com/project/set-up-git/"
target="_blank">Configure Git and fork the repo</a>.

	Your Git configuration can make it easier for you to contribute. 
	Configuration is especially key if are new to contributing or to Docker.

3. <a href="http://docs.docker.com/project/set-up-dev-env/"
target="_blank">Learn to work with the Docker development container</a>.
	
	Docker developers run `docker` in `docker`.  If you are a geek,
	this is a pretty cool experience.
4. <a href="http://docs.docker.com/project/find-an-issue/"
target="_blank">Find</a> and then <a
href="http://docs.docker.com/project/work-issue/" target="_blank">work on an
issue</a>.

	If you change or add code or docs to a project, you should test your changes
	as you work. This page explains <a
	href="http://docs.docker.com/project/test-and-docs/" target="_blank">how to
	test in our development environment</a>.

5. <a href="http://docs.docker.com/project/create-pr/" target="_blank">Create a
