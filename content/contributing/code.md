See <a href="https://github.com/docker" target="_blank">the complete list of
Docker repositories</a> on GitHub.

If you want to contribute to the `docker/docker` repository you should be
familiar with or a invested in learning Go or the Markdown language.  If you
know other languages, investigate our
other repositories&mdash;not all of them run on Go.

# Code contribution workflow

Below is the general workflow for contributing Docker code or documentation.
If you are an experienced open source contributor you may be familiar with this
workflow. If you are new or just need reminders, the steps below link to more
detailed documentation in Docker's project contributors guide.

1. <a href="http://docs.docker.com/project/software-required/"
target="_blank">Get the software</a> you need.

	This explains how to install a couple of tools used in our development
	environment.  What you need (or don't need) might surprise you.

2. <a href="http://docs.docker.com/project/set-up-git/"
target="_blank">Configure Git and fork the repo</a>.

	Your Git configuration can make it easier for you to contribute. 
	Configuration is especially key if are new to contributing or to Docker.

3. <a href="http://docs.docker.com/project/set-up-dev-env/"
target="_blank">Learn to work with the Docker development container</a>.
	
	Docker developers run `docker` in `docker`.  If you are a geek,
	this is a pretty cool experience.
4. <a href="http://docs.docker.com/project/find-an-issue/"
target="_blank">Find</a> and then <a
href="http://docs.docker.com/project/work-issue/" target="_blank">work on an
issue</a>.

	If you change or add code or docs to a project, you should test your changes
	as you work. This page explains <a
	href="http://docs.docker.com/project/test-and-docs/" target="_blank">how to
	test in our development environment</a>.  
	
	Also, remember to always **sign your commits** as you work! If you don't <a
	href="https://twitter.com/gordontheturtle" target="_blank">Gordon</a> will get
	you!

5. <a href="http://docs.docker.com/project/create-pr/" target="_blank">Create a
pull request</a>.

	If you make a change to fix an issue, add reference to the issue in the pull
	request. Here is a perfect example:

6. <a href="http://docs.docker.com/project/review-pr/"
target="_blank">Participate in the pull request review</a> till a successful
merge.
