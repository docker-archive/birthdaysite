With millions of Docker users all over the world, there's always someone who
needs a helping hand. Like many open source projects, the Docker project relies
on community support channels like forums, IRC, and StackOverflow.  You should
contribute mentoring if you have good knowledge of:

* how open source projects run
* using Docker in some particular domain (for example, testing or deployment)
* using Git, Go, GitHub, IRC, or other common tools

Also, choose mentoring if you like to be happy. Studies show that <a

boost your own well being.


# Where to help

If you are reading this at a Docker birthday event, look around you.  Is there
someone who looks puzzled or frustrated? Smile at this person and say *"Hey, can
I help you with something?"*  The next few sections list some other places to help.

## Docker users

Docker users are people using Docker in their daily work. For example, a user
might be deploying a Postgres database in a container. To help Docker users, visit:

* the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/docker-user"
target="_blank">Docker-user</a> Google group
* the `#docker` channel on Freenode IRC
*  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=newest&q=docker"
target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>

      
## Docker contributors

Docker contributors are people like you contributing to Docker open source. 
Contributors may need help with IRC, Go programming, Markdown, or with other
aspects of contributing. To help Docker contributors:

* the <a href="https://gitter.im/docker/docker" target="_blank">Docker Gitter IM
</a> room 
* the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/docker-dev"
target="_blank">docker-dev</a>  Google group
