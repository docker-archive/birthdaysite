Open source projects traditionally lack visual and graphical expertise. Browse
GitHub, you'll see many projects suffering from lame logos, iffy illustrations,
and sad CSS. If you have graphical talents, open source needs them and so do we!

**Fact**: Docker's own Moby Dock logo was contributed by a member of our
community.


# What kind of graphic?

A graphic can be anything from a mascot for the project or a diagram to make the
a concept more clear. Here’s a list of suggested visual/graphical things you can
tackle:

* Use Illustrator, Photoshop, or similar to suggest a redesign of a Docker UI.
* Suggest a better typeface for the <a href="https://blog.docker.com"
target="_blank">Docker Blog</a>.
* Create a <a href="http://goo.gl/s83L3D" target="_blank">Gordon logo</a> in the
style of the Docker logo or your own style.  
* Search the documentation for <a
href="http://docs.docker.com/project/make-a-contribution/"
target="_blank">existing</a> but <a
href="http://docs.docker.com/introduction/understanding-docker/#what-is-dockers-
architecture" target="_blank">poorly executed graphics</a> and improve them.  
* Design alternative themes for sites.

# How to contribute graphics

1. Choose from <a href="http://goo.gl/2KyMBo" target="_blank">a list of our
existing graphic issues</a> or create one of your own.

2. Create the graphic or other artwork.

	You can create an illustration in any application. The source file for the
	artwork could be a PSD, an AI, or a SVG file.  Of course, you also might just
	submit a CSS file if it fits the task you took on.

3. <a href="http://goo.gl/T0aSqd" target="_blank">License the output</a> to Docker. 

4.  Optionally, write a `README.txt` file to explain your work.

	For example, if the image should go into a specific point in the
	documentation, explain where. Also, include the document's URL in your
	README.  

5.  Submit the source file(s), `README.txt`, and completed license <a
href="https://dev.dockerproject.com/c/share" target="_blank">on our Discourse share</a>.
