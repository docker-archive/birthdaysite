One area where open source projects traditionally lack is in the visual and
graphical expertise. Browse GitHub, you'll see many projects suffering from lame logos,
iffy illustrations, and sad CSS. If you have graphical talents, open
source needs them and so do we!

**Fact**: Docker's own Moby Dock logo was contributed by a member of our community.

# What is a graphic

A graphic can be anything from a mascot for the project or a diagram to make
the a concept more clear. Here’s a list of suggested visual/graphical things you can tackle:

* Use Illustrator, Photoshop, or similar to suggest a redesign of a Docker UI.
* Suggest a better typeface for the <a href="https://blog.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker Blog</a>.
* Create a <a href="http://goo.gl/s83L3D" target="_blank">Gordon logo</a> in the style of the Docker logo or your own style.  
* Search the documentation for <a href="http://docs.docker.com/project/make-a-contribution/" target="_blank">existing</a> but <a href="http://docs.docker.com/introduction/understanding-docker/#what-is-dockers-architecture" target="_blank">poorly executed graphics</a> and improve them.  
* Design alternative themes for sites.
