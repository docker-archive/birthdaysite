# ![Docker Party](/images/2-years.png)

From March 23rd through April 19th, any contributions made to the Docker Project will count toward Docker’s donation ($50 per contribution) to the Oceanic Society and its mission to conserve the habitat of Moby Dock and blue whales across the planet.

## How to participate

There is no specific date or time for the online event - all you need is a computer and a desire to get involved in open source! To learn more, check out [our presentation created for the birthday week's events](/images/presentation.pdf). 

We also have almost all you'll need to start contributing right here! Just see the [Getting Started](/getting-started) on this site.

## Getting help

As with the in-person events, the Docker Project team members and expert developers from the broader open source community will be online to help guide you through contributing. 

## Mentor online

If you are interested in volunteering to guide online participants, please [sign up to be a mentor](http://goo.gl/forms/TAFVpnh3K8).
