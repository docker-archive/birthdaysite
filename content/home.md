![Docker Party](/images/2-years.png)

During the week of March 23rd, the docker community will be hosting [over a
dozen open-source-a-thon parties](/events) around the world. At these parties
the Docker core team and expert developers from the broader open source
community will teach and guide participants on how to contribute to open
source.

# Charity

Contributions to the project at these events and in the weeks following will
count toward our donation to the [Oceanic Society](http://www.oceanicsociety.org) and its mission to conserve
the habitat of Moby Dock and blue whales across the planet. 

# Who

We invite everyone with even the smallest desire to be a part open source or
people who just want to help out with a great cause to attend regardless of
technical experience. We will have Docker core team members at each event as
well as experts from both the Docker and Go communities to mentor and teach
people how to write Go (the language Docker is written in) and contribute to
Docker. 

Participants will:

* Learn how to contribute to open source
* Learn about the Docker Project
* Learn Go
* Contribute regardless of their technical experience
* Help marine wildlife (a donation will be made for every contribution)
* Enjoy food and drinks
 

Mentors will:

* Teach people how to contribute to open source
* Introduce participants to Go
* Help with git
* Mentor with code contributions
* Help marine wildlife (a donation will be made for every mentor)
* (Also) enjoy food and drinks
 

# What

While we hope to get many contributions in the form of code, we expect many
more contributions from participants in other forms including documentation,
tutorials, videos, artwork, organization, answering questions and mentoring at
the events themselves. Regardless of your experience, you can contribute and
make a difference.  

In addition to the [in person events](/events) we will also be hosting an [online
open-source-a-thon](/online).

# Thanks

This event is thanks to the many wonderful people throughout the world who
contribute their time and talents to open source. This includes our awesome
meetup organizers who, without their efforts this would not be possible.
